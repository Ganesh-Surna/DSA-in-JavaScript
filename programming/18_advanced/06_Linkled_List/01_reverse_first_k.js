/* Problem:
Given a linked list and a number k, reverse the first k nodes of the linked list.

Example 1:
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6, k = 3
Output: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
Explanation: Reverse first 3 nodes (1, 2, 3), keep rest unchanged

Example 2:
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, k = 2
Output: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Explanation: Reverse first 2 nodes (1, 2), keep rest unchanged

Example 3:
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3, k = 3
Output: 3 -> 2 -> 1
Explanation: Reverse all 3 nodes

Example 4:
Input: 1 -> 2, k = 1
Output: 1 -> 2
Explanation: Reverse first 1 node (no change)

Constraints:
1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ length of linked list
1 ‚â§ node values ‚â§ 1000

Expected Time Complexity: O(k)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

/*üéØ CORE IDEA: Instead of using recursive approaches or extra data structures, we use ITERATIVE REVERSAL with THREE POINTERS to efficiently reverse the first k nodes in O(k) time and O(1) space.

üìã STEP-BY-STEP FLOW:

1Ô∏è‚É£ THREE POINTER TECHNIQUE:
   - prev: Points to previous node (initially null)
   - curr: Points to current node (initially head)
   - next: Points to next node (temporary storage)

2Ô∏è‚É£ ITERATIVE REVERSAL:
   - Store next node before breaking link
   - Reverse current node's next pointer
   - Move pointers forward
   - Count processed nodes

3Ô∏è‚É£ TERMINATION CONDITION:
   - When count reaches k, stop reversal
   - Connect original head to remaining list
   - Update head to new first node

4Ô∏è‚É£ LINK RECONSTRUCTION:
   - Original head.next = remaining list
   - New head = last reversed node

üß† WHY THIS APPROACH?

1Ô∏è‚É£ EFFICIENCY: O(k) vs O(n) for full traversal
2Ô∏è‚É£ SPACE OPTIMIZATION: O(1) vs O(k) for recursive stack
3Ô∏è‚É£ ITERATIVE: Avoids recursion overhead
4Ô∏è‚É£ IN-PLACE: Modifies existing nodes without extra space

üí° KEY INSIGHTS:

1Ô∏è‚É£ THREE POINTERS: prev, curr, next enable efficient reversal
2Ô∏è‚É£ COUNTING: Track processed nodes to stop at k
3Ô∏è‚É£ LINK PRESERVATION: Store next before breaking current link
4Ô∏è‚É£ HEAD UPDATE: Return new head after reversal

üéØ WHY THREE POINTERS WORK?
- prev: Maintains reversed portion
- curr: Current node being processed
- next: Preserves forward traversal path

üéØ ALGORITHM INTUITION:
Think of it as "unzipping" the first k nodes and "rezipping" them in reverse order,
while keeping the rest of the list intact.

üîç WHY THIS WORKS:
1Ô∏è‚É£ THREE POINTERS enable efficient node reversal
2Ô∏è‚É£ COUNTING ensures we stop at exactly k nodes
3Ô∏è‚É£ LINK PRESERVATION maintains list connectivity
4Ô∏è‚É£ HEAD UPDATE returns correct new head

üí° KEY INSIGHT:
We don't need to traverse the entire list - we only process the first k nodes!
This gives us O(k) complexity instead of O(n) for full traversal.

üéØ TIME COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
- Traverse first k nodes: O(k)
- Each node operation: O(1)
- Total: O(k)

üéØ SPACE COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
- Three pointers: O(1)
- Counter variable: O(1)
- No extra data structures: O(1)
- Total: O(1)

üéØ EDGE CASES HANDLED:
- k = 1: No reversal needed, return original head
- k = list length: Reverse entire list
- Single node: Return as is
- Empty list: Handle gracefully

üéØ COMPARISON WITH OTHER APPROACHES:
- Recursive: O(k) time, O(k) space (recursion stack)
- Array-based: O(n) time, O(n) space (copy to array)
- Three-pointer: O(k) time, O(1) space - optimal!

üéØ OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES:
- Use three pointers instead of recursion
- Count nodes during traversal
- Update head in-place
- Preserve links efficiently

üéØ LINKED LIST MANIPULATION PRINCIPLES:
- Always store next before breaking current link
- Use multiple pointers for complex operations
- Update head pointer when structure changes
- Handle edge cases (empty, single node)

üéØ REVERSAL PATTERN:
- Store next node
- Reverse current link
- Move pointers forward
- Repeat until condition met

üéØ POINTER MOVEMENT VISUALIZATION:

ITERATION 1:
prev: null -> 10
curr: 10 -> 20
next: 20 -> 30

ITERATION 2:
prev: 10 -> 20
curr: 20 -> 30
next: 30 -> 40

ITERATION 3:
prev: 20 -> 30
curr: 30 -> 40
next: 40 -> 50

TERMINATION:
head: 10 -> 30 (new head)
head.next: 30 -> 40 (connect to remaining)

üéØ ALGORITHM CORRECTNESS:
- Each iteration reverses exactly one link
- Count ensures we process exactly k nodes
- Head update ensures correct return value
- Link preservation maintains list integrity

üéØ UPDATED ALGORITHM ANALYSIS:

The updated code uses a cleaner approach:
- Loop condition: `while(curr !== null && c < k)` - stops when count reaches k
- After loop: `head.next = curr` - connects original head to remaining list
- After loop: `head = prev` - updates head to new first node
- Return: `return head` - returns new head

This is more efficient because:
1Ô∏è‚É£ CLEANER TERMINATION: Loop stops exactly at k iterations
2Ô∏è‚É£ SIMPLER LOGIC: No need for if condition inside loop
3Ô∏è‚É£ BETTER READABILITY: Clear separation of reversal and connection logic
4Ô∏è‚É£ SAME COMPLEXITY: Still O(k) time and O(1) space

üéØ WHY THE UPDATED APPROACH IS BETTER:

1Ô∏è‚É£ LOOP CONDITION: `c < k` ensures we stop exactly at k nodes
2Ô∏è‚É£ POST-LOOP PROCESSING: Clean separation of concerns
3Ô∏è‚É£ POINTER MANAGEMENT: prev points to last reversed node (new head)
4Ô∏è‚É£ CONNECTION LOGIC: head.next = curr connects to remaining list

üéØ STEP-BY-STEP WITH UPDATED CODE:

INITIALIZATION:
prev = null, curr = head(10), c = 1

ITERATION 1 (c = 1, c < k = 3):
next = 20, curr.next = null, prev = 10, curr = 20, c = 2
List: null <- 10    20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50 -> 60

ITERATION 2 (c = 2, c < k = 3):
next = 30, curr.next = 10, prev = 20, curr = 30, c = 3
List: null <- 10 <- 20    30 -> 40 -> 50 -> 60

ITERATION 3 (c = 3, c < k = 3):
next = 40, curr.next = 20, prev = 30, curr = 40, c = 4
List: null <- 10 <- 20 <- 30    40 -> 50 -> 60

LOOP EXITS (c = 4, c >= k = 3):
head.next = curr = 40  // Connect original head to remaining
head = prev = 30       // Update head to new first node

FINAL RESULT: 30 -> 20 -> 10 -> 40 -> 50 -> 60

üéØ ALGORITHM EFFICIENCY:
- Time: O(k) - only processes first k nodes
- Space: O(1) - uses only three pointers and one counter
- Optimal: No better approach exists for this problem

üéØ KEY DIFFERENCES FROM PREVIOUS VERSION:
- Cleaner loop condition: `c < k` instead of `c === k`
- Post-loop processing: Connection logic outside the loop
- Better readability: Clear separation of concerns
- Same performance: O(k) time, O(1) space
