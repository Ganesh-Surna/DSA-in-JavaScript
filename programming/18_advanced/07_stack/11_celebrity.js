A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. 
A party is being organized by some people. 
A square matrix mat[][] of size n*n is used to represent people at the party such that
if an element of row i and column j is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. 
You need to return the index of the celebrity in the party, if the celebrity does not exist, return -1.

Note: Follow 0-based indexing.

Examples:
_____________________________________

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 1, 0],
                [0, 1, 0],
                [0, 1, 1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: 0th and 2nd person both know 1st person and 1st person does not know anyone. Therefore, 1 is the celebrity person.
_____________________________________

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 1], 
                [1, 1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: Since both the people at the party know each other. Hence none of them is a celebrity person.
_____________________________________

Input: mat[][] = [[1]]
Output: 0
_____________________________________

Constraints:
1 ≤ mat.size() ≤ 1000
0 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 1
mat[i][i] = 1

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

// ✅ TC = O(n)
// ✅ SC = O(1)
function findCelebrity(mat) {
    let n = mat.length;

    // Step 1: Find the potential celebrity
    let candidate = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (mat[candidate][i] === 1) {
            // candidate knows i. Means candidate can't be celebrity
            candidate = i;
        }
        // else, i can't be celebrity, continue
    }

    // Step 2: Verify the candidate
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i !== candidate) {
            // celebrity should NOT know i
            if (mat[candidate][i] === 1) return -1;
            // everyone else should know celebrity
            if (mat[i][candidate] === 0) return -1;
        }
    }

    return candidate;
}

// Example 1
console.log(findCelebrity([[1, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 1]])); // Output: 1

// Example 2
console.log(findCelebrity([[1, 1],
    [1, 1]])); // Output: -1

// Example 3
console.log(findCelebrity([[1]])); // Output: 0


/*🎯 CORE IDEA: Use elimination technique to find potential celebrity in first pass, then verify the candidate in second pass. The key insight is that if candidate knows someone, they can't be celebrity, so eliminate them.

📋 STEP-BY-STEP FLOW:

1️⃣ FIND POTENTIAL CELEBRITY:
   - Start with candidate = 0
   - For each person i from 1 to n-1
   - If candidate knows i, eliminate candidate and set candidate = i
   - If candidate doesn't know i, eliminate i (continue)

2️⃣ VERIFY THE CANDIDATE:
   - Check if candidate knows anyone (should be 0 for all)
   - Check if everyone knows candidate (should be 1 for all)
   - Return candidate if valid, -1 if invalid

🧠 WHY THIS APPROACH?
- Elimination technique reduces candidates efficiently
- At most one celebrity can exist
- Two-pass verification ensures correctness
- Optimal O(n) time complexity

💡 KEY INSIGHTS:
- Use elimination technique for candidate finding
- Verify candidate with two conditions
- At most one celebrity can exist
- Efficient O(n) solution


🎯 DETAILED OPERATION WALKTHROUGH:

📊 EXAMPLE 1: [[1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]

INPUT: 3x3 matrix representing people at party
OUTPUT: 1 (person 1 is the celebrity)
EXPLANATION: Person 1 is known by all but knows no one

🎯 GOAL: Find the celebrity using elimination technique!

🔍 STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:

📋 INITIALIZATION:
n = 3
candidate = 0

📋 STEP 1: FIND POTENTIAL CELEBRITY (Elimination)

ITERATION 1: i = 1
mat[0][1] = 1 (candidate 0 knows person 1)
Since candidate knows someone, candidate can't be celebrity
candidate = 1

ITERATION 2: i = 2
mat[1][2] = 0 (candidate 1 doesn't know person 2)
Since candidate doesn't know person 2, person 2 can't be celebrity
candidate remains 1

📋 STEP 2: VERIFY THE CANDIDATE

VERIFICATION 1: Check if candidate 1 knows anyone
mat[1][0] = 0 ✓ (doesn't know person 0)
mat[1][1] = 1 ✓ (knows self - this is always true)
mat[1][2] = 0 ✓ (doesn't know person 2)

VERIFICATION 2: Check if everyone knows candidate 1
mat[0][1] = 1 ✓ (person 0 knows candidate 1)
mat[1][1] = 1 ✓ (candidate 1 knows self)
mat[2][1] = 1 ✓ (person 2 knows candidate 1)

🏆 RESULT: 1 (Person 1 is the celebrity)

─────────────────────────────────────────

📊 EXAMPLE 2: [[1, 1], [1, 1]]

INPUT: 2x2 matrix
OUTPUT: -1 (no celebrity exists)
EXPLANATION: Both people know each other

🔍 Process:

STEP 1: FIND POTENTIAL CELEBRITY
ITERATION 1: i = 1
mat[0][1] = 1 (candidate 0 knows person 1)
candidate = 1

STEP 2: VERIFY THE CANDIDATE
VERIFICATION 1: Check if candidate 1 knows anyone
mat[1][0] = 1 ✗ (knows person 0 - violates celebrity condition)
Return -1

🏆 RESULT: -1 (No celebrity exists)

─────────────────────────────────────────

📊 EXAMPLE 3: [[1]]

INPUT: 1x1 matrix
OUTPUT: 0 (person 0 is the celebrity)
EXPLANATION: Single person is always celebrity

🔍 Process:

STEP 1: FIND POTENTIAL CELEBRITY
No iterations (only one person)
candidate = 0

STEP 2: VERIFY THE CANDIDATE
VERIFICATION 1: Check if candidate 0 knows anyone
mat[0][0] = 1 ✓ (knows self - always true)

VERIFICATION 2: Check if everyone knows candidate 0
mat[0][0] = 1 ✓ (knows self)

🏆 RESULT: 0 (Person 0 is the celebrity)

─────────────────────────────────────────

📊 VISUAL REPRESENTATION:

EXAMPLE 1 MATRIX:
┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
│  1  │  1  │  0  │ ← Person 0
├─────┼─────┼─────┤
│  0  │  1  │  0  │ ← Person 1 (Celebrity)
├─────┼─────┼─────┤
│  0  │  1  │  1  │ ← Person 2
└─────┴─────┴─────┘
   ↑     ↑     ↑
Person 0 Person 1 Person 2

CELEBRITY CONDITIONS:
✓ Person 1 doesn't know anyone (row 1: [0, 1, 0])
✓ Everyone knows person 1 (column 1: [1, 1, 1])

─────────────────────────────────────────

📊 ELIMINATION TECHNIQUE:

ORIGINAL CANDIDATES: [0, 1, 2]

ITERATION 1: Check candidate 0 vs person 1
mat[0][1] = 1 → candidate 0 knows person 1
ELIMINATE: candidate 0 (can't be celebrity)
NEW CANDIDATE: 1

ITERATION 2: Check candidate 1 vs person 2
mat[1][2] = 0 → candidate 1 doesn't know person 2
ELIMINATE: person 2 (can't be celebrity)
FINAL CANDIDATE: 1

─────────────────────────────────────────

🔍 WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS:
1️⃣ ELIMINATION TECHNIQUE: Efficiently reduces candidates
2️⃣ AT MOST ONE CELEBRITY: Mathematical property
3️⃣ TWO-PASS VERIFICATION: Ensures correctness
4️⃣ OPTIMAL COMPLEXITY: O(n) time and O(1) space
5️⃣ CORRECT RESULTS: Guaranteed to find celebrity if exists

💡 KEY INSIGHT:
Use elimination technique to find potential celebrity,
then verify with two conditions!

🎯 TIME COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
- Candidate finding: O(n) - single pass through people
- Verification: O(n) - check all relationships
- Total: O(n) time complexity

🎯 SPACE COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
- Only candidate variable used: O(1)
- No extra data structures needed
- Optimal space complexity

🎯 EDGE CASES HANDLED:
- Single person: always celebrity
- No celebrity: return -1
- Multiple candidates: elimination ensures only one
- All know each other: return -1
- Matrix constraints: handled correctly

🎯 ALGORITHM CORRECTNESS:
- Guaranteed to find celebrity if exists
- Guaranteed to return -1 if no celebrity
- Elimination technique is mathematically sound
- Verification ensures correctness

🎯 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

- Optimal O(n) time and O(1) space

🎯 ELIMINATION PRINCIPLE:
- If candidate knows someone, eliminate candidate
- If candidate doesn't know someone, eliminate that person
- At most one celebrity can exist
- Efficient reduction of candidates

🎯 VERIFICATION CONDITIONS:
- Celebrity knows no one: mat[candidate][i] = 0 for all i ≠ candidate
- Everyone knows celebrity: mat[i][candidate] = 1 for all i
- Self-knowledge: mat[candidate][candidate] = 1 (always true)

🎯 COMPARISON WITH NAIVE APPROACH:
