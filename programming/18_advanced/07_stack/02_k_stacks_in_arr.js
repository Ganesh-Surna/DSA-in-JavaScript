/* Problem: ✅✅✅✅ K Stacks in One Array ✅✅✅✅

Implement K stacks in a single array efficiently using a free list approach.

Given an array of size n and k stacks, implement all k stacks such that:
- All stacks share the same array space
- No overflow occurs until the entire array is full
- Each stack can grow independently
- Efficient push/pop operations for all stacks

Example 1:
Input: capacity = 6, k = 3
Operations:
- push(0, 10) → true (push 10 to stack 0)
- push(1, 20) → true (push 20 to stack 1)
- push(2, 30) → true (push 30 to stack 2)
- push(0, 40) → true (push 40 to stack 0)
- push(1, 50) → true (push 50 to stack 1)
- push(2, 60) → true (push 60 to stack 2)
- push(0, 70) → false (overflow)
- pop(0) → 40, pop(1) → 50, pop(2) → 60

Example 2:
Input: capacity = 4, k = 2
Operations:
- push(0, 1), push(1, 2), push(0, 3), push(1, 4) → all true
- push(0, 5) → false (overflow)
- pop(0) → 3, pop(1) → 4, pop(0) → 1, pop(1) → 2

Constraints:
- 1 <= capacity <= 10^6
- 1 <= k <= capacity
- -10^9 <= value <= 10^9
- At most 10^5 operations will be performed

Expected Time Complexity: O(1) for all operations
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n + k) for arrays

        this.freeTop = i;
        
        return this.arr[i] // returning item at that index in arr
    }
    isFull(){
        return this.freeTop === -1 // no free slot, means all stacks are filled. (arr is full)
    }
    isEmpty(sn){
        return this.top[sn] === -1 // if top of the stack is -1 means the stack is empty
    }
}

/*🎯 CORE IDEA: Implement K stacks in a single array using a FREE LIST approach with linked list structure.

📋 STEP-BY-STEP FLOW:

1️⃣ INITIALIZATION:
   - Create array of size n for data storage
   - Create top array of size k (top index of each stack)
   - Create next array of size n (linked list of free slots)
   - Initialize freeTop = 0 (start of free list)
   - Initialize free list: next[i] = i+1, next[n-1] = -1

2️⃣ PUSH OPERATION:
   - Check if array is full (freeTop === -1)
   - Get free slot index i = freeTop
   - Store data: arr[i] = x
   - Update free list: freeTop = next[i]
   - Link to stack: next[i] = top[sn]
   - Update stack top: top[sn] = i

3️⃣ POP OPERATION:
   - Check if stack is empty (top[sn] === -1)
   - Get top index: i = top[sn]
   - Update stack top: top[sn] = next[i]
   - Add to free list: next[i] = freeTop, freeTop = i
   - Return data: arr[i]

4️⃣ HELPER OPERATIONS:
   - isFull(): freeTop === -1
   - isEmpty(sn): top[sn] === -1

🧠 WHY THIS APPROACH?
- Space efficient: Single array for all K stacks
- Optimal time complexity: O(1) for all operations
- Flexible: Each stack can grow independently
- Dynamic: Free slots managed automatically

💡 KEY INSIGHTS:
- Free list approach: Tracks available slots
- Linked list structure: next[i] points to previous element
- Stack independence: Each stack has its own top pointer
- Space utilization: Maximum when array is full

📊 FREE LIST MECHANISM:

PUSH OPERATION:
1. Get free slot: i = freeTop
2. Store data: arr[i] = x
3. Update free list: freeTop = next[i]
4. Link to stack: next[i] = top[sn]
5. Update stack: top[sn] = i

POP OPERATION:
1. Get top index: i = top[sn]
2. Update stack: top[sn] = next[i]
3. Add to free list: next[i] = freeTop, freeTop = i
4. Return data: arr[i]

🔍 WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS:
1️⃣ FREE LIST MANAGEMENT: Tracks available slots efficiently
2️⃣ LINKED LIST STRUCTURE: Each stack maintains its own chain
3️⃣ SPACE EFFICIENCY: Single array for all K stacks
4️⃣ OPTIMAL TIME: O(1) for all operations
5️⃣ FLEXIBLE GROWTH: Each stack grows independently

💡 KEY INSIGHT:
Free list approach with linked list structure allows K stacks
to share array space efficiently while maintaining O(1) operations!

🎯 TIME COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
- push: O(1) - constant time operations
- pop: O(1) - constant time operations
- isFull: O(1) - simple comparison
- isEmpty: O(1) - simple comparison
- All operations are optimal

🎯 SPACE COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
- arr: O(n) for data storage
- top: O(k) for stack pointers
- next: O(n) for linked list structure
- Total: O(n + k) - optimal for K stacks

🎯 EDGE CASES HANDLED:
- Empty stacks (underflow)
- Full array (overflow)
- Single element operations
- Maximum capacity utilization
- All K stacks empty/full

🎯 ALGORITHM CORRECTNESS:
- Guaranteed overflow detection
- Guaranteed underflow detection
- Maintains stack properties (LIFO)
- Optimal space utilization
- Handles all edge cases

🎯 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Overflow: freeTop === -1
- Underflow: top[sn] === -1
- Free list: next[i] = i+1 initially
- Stack linking: next[i] = top[sn]
- Free list update: next[i] = freeTop, freeTop = i

🎯 SPACE UTILIZATION PATTERNS:
- Best case: Equal distribution across stacks
- Worst case: One stack dominates
- Average case: Depends on usage pattern
- Maximum: 100% array utilization

🎯 COMPARISON WITH SEPARATE STACKS:
- Space: O(n+k) vs O(n*k) for separate arrays
- Time: Same O(1) for all operations
- Flexibility: Better space utilization
- Complexity: More complex but efficient

🎯 REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS:
- Memory management systems
- Multi-stack data structures
- Space-constrained environments
- Efficient resource allocation
- Operating system stacks

🎯 OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES:
- Dynamic resizing (advanced)
- Memory pooling
- Cache-friendly access patterns
- Lazy initialization

🎯 STACK PROPERTIES MAINTAINED:
- LIFO (Last In, First Out)
- Push/Pop operations
- Independent operation
- Overflow/Underflow detection
- Size tracking (implicit)

🎯 BOUNDARY CONDITIONS:
- Empty array initialization
- Single element operations
- Maximum capacity reached
- Minimum capacity (size 1)
- All stacks empty/full

🎯 ERROR HANDLING:
- Overflow: Return false
- Underflow: Return null
- Invalid stack number: Handle gracefully
- Boundary checks: Comprehensive
- State validation: Consistent

🎯 FREE LIST ADVANTAGES:
- Efficient space management
- O(1) allocation/deallocation
- No fragmentation
- Dynamic growth
- Simple implementation

🎯 LINKED LIST STRUCTURE:
- Each stack maintains its own chain
- next[i] points to previous element
- top[sn] points to current top
- -1 indicates end of chain
- Efficient traversal
