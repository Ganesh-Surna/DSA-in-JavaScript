/*
Applications of DFS (Graph)
---------------------------------
1) Cycle detection
   - Detect cycles using recursion stack (directed) or parent check (undirected).

2) Topological sorting (DAG)
   - Postorder/stack order from DFS yields a valid topological order.

3) Strongly Connected Components (SCC)
   - Kosaraju (two DFS passes) or Tarjan (single DFS with lowlink values) are two algorithms to find SCCs.

4) Solving mazes and similar puzzles
   - Backtracking/DFS explores paths deeply; useful for enumerating solutions.

5) Path finding
   - Find any path between two nodes; enumerate all paths with backtracking.




// More DFS uses
6) Articulation points and bridges (undirected)
   - DFS discovery/low times identify critical vertices/edges.

7) Detecting/Building DFS tree and discovery/finish times
   - Useful in algorithm analysis and classifying edges.

8) Top-down dynamic programming on DAGs/trees
   - DFS order to process dependencies once.

9) Generating permutations/combinations (implicit graphs)
   - Classic backtracking patterns modeled as DFS on state-space graphs.

10) Connected components (undirected)
    - Run DFS from each unvisited node to label components.
