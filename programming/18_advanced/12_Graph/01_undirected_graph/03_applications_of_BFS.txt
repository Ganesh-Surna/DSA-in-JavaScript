/*
Applications of BFS (Graph)
---------------------------------
1) Shortest path in an unweighted graph
   - BFS finds minimum-edge paths from a source to all reachable vertices.

2) Crawlers in search engines
   - Layer-by-layer web crawling (discover pages by distance from seeds).

3) Peer-to-peer networks
   - Discover nearby peers/resources by hop count; flood-limited searches.

4) Social networking search
   - Find degrees of separation; suggest connections by BFS levels.

5) Garbage collection (Cheney's algorithm)
   - Copying GC scans reachable objects using BFS from roots.

6) Cycle detection (in undirected graphs)
   - Using BFS with parent tracking to detect back-edges.

7) Ford–Fulkerson/Edmonds–Karp algorithm
   - Uses BFS to find shortest augmenting paths in residual networks.

8) Broadcasting
   - Propagate messages level-by-level to all nodes in networks.

More applications of BFS
---------------------------------
9) Connected components (undirected)
   - Run BFS from every unvisited node to label components.

10) Bipartite checking
    - Two-color the graph by BFS levels; conflict ⇒ not bipartite.

11) All nodes at distance K
    - Level-order distances give exact nodes K hops from a source.

12) Minimum edges between two nodes
    - Shortest path by number of edges in any unweighted graph.

13) Grid/maze shortest path
    - Treat cells as nodes; BFS finds fewest steps to target.

14) Knight moves on chessboard
    - Model legal knight moves; BFS gives minimum moves.

15) Snakes and Ladders (minimum dice throws)
    - Board positions as nodes with edges via throws/ladders/snakes.

16) Kahn’s algorithm for topological order (DAG)
    - Uses BFS over zero in-degree vertices to output topo order.

17) Routing/Tree construction from a root
    - BFS tree yields parent pointers for shortest-hop routing.

18) Influence/contagion spread simulation
    - Discrete-time propagation over levels approximated by BFS waves.
