// Approach
// Step1: Start from the Root: Begin traversing the tree starting from the root node.

// Step2: Compare Values: At each node, compare the values of p and q with the current node's value.

//      case1: If both p and q are greater than the current node's value, then the LCA must be in the right subtree.

//      case2: If both p and q are less than the current node's value, then the LCA must be in the left subtree.

//      case3: If one of p or q is equal to the current node's value, or if p and q are on different sides of the current node, then the current node is the LCA.

// Step6: Recursive or Iterative Traversal: This logic can be implemented either recursively or iteratively. The iterative approach is often preferred for its constant space complexity.
